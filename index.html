				Obviously this recipe sounds delicious, but why make marry me chicken tonight? Dive into a bite of tender chicken breast with sun-dried tomatoes, herbs, and a luscious cream sauce. Minimal ingredients make this recipe budget friendly. Want even better news? Trying to feed a crowd or looking to bulk this dish up a bit?

				<h2>Soup</h2>

			<div class="section_text">
				 I have made this potato soup for many whom have given it this title. It takes a bit of effort but is well worth it. Please note: for those who do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease and continue with the recipe. (I generally serve this soup as a special treat.)
